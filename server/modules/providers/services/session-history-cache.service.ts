/**
 * Full-transcript cache for session history reads.
 *
 * Every provider history reader materializes the complete normalized
 * transcript and then slices out the requested page, so serving a 20-row page
 * of a large session re-read and re-parsed the whole transcript file on every
 * request — opening a session, each older page while scrolling up, and every
 * post-turn refresh. For a multi-megabyte JSONL that is most of a second of
 * CPU per request.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by app session id and validated with one `stat` per
 * request against the transcript file's identity (path + mtime + size), so
 * only the first read after the file changes pays the parse. Anything that
 * rewrites history (a new turn, an edit, a rewind, a fork) touches the file
 * and invalidates naturally. The one exception is a change the file does not
 * show: the page's token usage also depends on in-memory state (the context
 * window the SDK reported, the post-compact reading), so whoever stores that
 * state calls `invalidate(sessionId)`. The Claude runtime does, per session.
 *
 * Only history readers that read `jsonl_path` itself may use this cache —
 * callers pass `transcriptPath: null` for providers whose messages live
 * elsewhere (Cursor's store.db, OpenCode's shared SQLite), which bypasses
 * caching entirely.
